# Sort
This is a simple text sorting utility that sort lines of text in a alphabetical order. It can be used in the following ways:
    - ./sort (sort what is read from stdin to stdout)
    - ./sort input (sort what is read from input to stdout)
    - ./sort input output (sort what is read from input to output)

Because a project description is missing from the original repo, this is what I anticipated.
